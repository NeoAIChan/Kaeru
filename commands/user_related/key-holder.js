		*$randomText[Above the rest, that's where I deserve to be;Ha! Thought it will be harder;For years I wandered, only to seek unequaled power;Isn't it fun to tease those hopeful minds;Weaklings are nothing but offerings;Enjoy your last meal!;Demons shall bathe in their blood, the light belongs to the righteous;Don't fall into my sweet trap;Only the strongest shall survive;Don't stick your nose, where it doesn't belong;All the niminy-piminy fools will end up fooling themselves;Attack! If you dare!;The hellfire will burn you into ashes;The ocean sees through your cowardice and fear;Hey Detona, this one's even dumber than you!;It's not your fault being defeated by me;Power always comes at the cost of life;This is the sound of your defeat!;Conceding defeat is an easier option to them;Watch out bad guys! Falling stars will hit you right on your head;The man who can beat me has not been born yet;Me, a thief? No, no, no. I'm only borrowing this;You have merely 2 seconds;Who would recognize someone as weak as you;Let's see who has the last laugh;Pain is my greatest gift to you;Time to teach you guys a lesson;If you are the most honorable warrior of this land, then prove it;Stop pissing me off, or I'll destroy you;Your death is music to my ears;Fend off my daggers? Don't even think about it;I have prepared a different way of death for everyone;Ame no Habakiri will devour you;Evildoer, prepare for your judgement;Betrayal, must be paid back #SEMI# by blood;Your death, doesn't concern me;You cannot bear my wrath;I'll crush you into pieces;The southern seas are my domain;Demon, you shall not even have the opportunity to tremble;Cowards don't deserve peace;I shall be the end of you;Pain is my special gift, just for you;I have no sympathy to spare for evil doers;I kill whoever I want to kill!;A painless lesson is also meaningless;You can't have order without chaos;Your life is worthless, but I will take it anyway;I'll show you what fighting really is;Your cowardice will only arouse my fury;Any luck you could run from this;Didn't your mother ever tell you? Never get too close to needles;Do not try my patience, or rage;Take another step and you'll regret it;You can't run from my arrow;I'll relish your pain;You will be punished if you've done something wrong;Give me names and I will give you blood;Our perception is our reality;Love outshines the golden crown;You didn't lose, you learned a lesson;You don't know how close death is;Tremble in my presence;You know what? Carrying four fools to victory isn't easy;The light is only the thing you cannot shadow;No one can hide from me;I love the feeling of chasing prey;Kill.. all.. at once;Fools will eventually die from stupidity;They are walking on thin ice;Revenge has consumed me;Is that who must go, treachery is for cowards;Only the strong deserve to rule;I do not back out, I lead with honor, as I am the Vanguard of the Light's Order;All intruders, shall be expelled;Hmph, you can no longer move. Don't even try;Who dare stand against me;Humans, disposable by design;My darts spare no one;Let fire incinerate all evils;Tough enemies I don't fear. Dumb allies...;Struggle is meaningless;Only by facing the enemy can one know his true self;Only the weak doubt;The creators would die, just like their creations;Me? No, it's you who put yourselves in danger;How does it feel ending up on my plate;Retreat or death, you decide]*;{newEmbed:{color:$getRoleColor[$getVar[keyRole]]}
